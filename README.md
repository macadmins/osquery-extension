# macadmins-extension

## Usage

For testing, you can load the extension with `osqueryi`.

By default, osquery does not want to load extensions not owned by root. You can either change the ownership of macadmins_extension.ext to root, or run osquery with the `--allow_unsafe` flag.

```bash
osqueryi --extension /path/to/macadmins_extension.ext
```

For production deployment, you should refer to the [osquery documentation](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/extensions/).

Due to changes in macOS 12.3, the output of `profiles show -type enrollment` can only be generated once a day. If you are running this command with another tool, you should set the `PROFILES_SHOW_ENROLLMENT_CACHE_PATH` environment variable to the path you are caching this. The cache file should be `json` with the keys `dep_capable` and `rate_limited` present, both booleans representing whether the device is capable of DEP enrollment and whether the response from `profiles show -type enrollment` is being rate limited or not. |
