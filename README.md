# macadmins-extension

## Usage

For testing, you can load the extension with `osqueryi`.

By default, osquery does not want to load extensions not owned by root. You can either change the ownership of macadmins_extension.ext to root, or run osquery with the `--allow_unsafe` flag.

```bash
osqueryi --extension /path/to/macadmins_extension.ext
```

For production deployment, you should refer to the [osquery documentation](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/extensions/).

| `alt_system_info`            | Alternative system_info table | macOS | This table is an alternative to the built-in system_info table in osquery, which triggers an `Allow "osquery" to find devices on local networks?` prompt on macOS 15.0. On versions other than 15.0, this table falls back to the built-in system_info table. Note: this table returns an empty `cpu_subtype` field.

Due to changes in macOS 12.3, the output of `profiles show -type enrollment` can only be generated once a day. If you are running this command with another tool, you should set the `PROFILES_SHOW_ENROLLMENT_CACHE_PATH` environment variable to the path you are caching this. The cache file should be `json` with the keys `dep_capable` and `rate_limited` present, both booleans representing whether the device is capable of DEP enrollment and whether the response from `profiles show -type enrollment` is being rate limited or not. |

| `wifi_network`               | Table to get the current wifi network name since the Osquery `wifi_info` table no longer does this. Includes the rest of the working fields in `wifi_info`. | macOS | See [osquery issue #8220](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/issues/8220) |
